    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza "Tlayuda" is a crispy, thin-crust Mexican pizza that is inspired by
      one of Oaxacaâ€™s most famous street foods. The base is a tortilla, the
      sauce is made with refried beans, and it is topped with cheese and
      veggies.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
      <li>6 large flour tortillas</li>
      <li>12 ounces grated Monterey Jack, Mozzarella, or Oaxacan cheese</li>
      <li>12 whole Brussels sprouts, cored and separated into leaves</li>
      <li>2/3 cup sliced green onions, green parts only</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced radishes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup red chili sauce or salsa</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cilantro leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat some of the avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 large
        flour tortilla at a time and cook until golden brown and almost crispy,
        2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Spread toasted tortilla with refried black beans and sprinkle with
        cheese. Top with Brussels sprouts leaves and green onions. Drizzle top
        lightly with olive oil, and season with a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is crispy and well browned,
        cheese is melted, and Brussels sprouts leaves are nicely charred on the
        edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack, and let sit for 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While resting, top with radishes, hot sauce or salsa, and cilantro
        leaves.
      </li>
    </ol>
