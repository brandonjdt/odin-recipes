    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border
      hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours
      in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several
      recipes but this is the best one by far.
